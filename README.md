## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### Useful resources


- [https://stackoverflow.com/a/9204568](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9204568) - A stackoverflow answer showing a very basic email validation via regex.

- [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp) - This is a regex reference. Useful to understant the regex expression in the email validation test on the javascript side of the application.
